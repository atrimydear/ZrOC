abstract = {Ceramic materials have obvious advantages in thermal stability, but impedance mismatch limits their ability to attenuate electromagnetic (EM) waves. Herein, a novel series of high-entropy (V0.2Nb0.2Zr0.2Ta0.2X0.2)B2 (X = Mo, Ti, and Hf) ceramics were successfully synthesized via ultrafast high-temperature sintering (UHS) apparatus based on joule heating. The results indicated that the effect of high-entropy component on the magnetic loss of the system was relatively small, but the effect on the dielectric loss was larger. Among them, the (V0.2Nb0.2Zr0.2Ta0.2Ti0.2)B2 (HEB-Ti) sample demonstrated superior absorbing properties due to relatively moderate dielectric loss and optimal EM impedance matching. Moreover, because of its relatively moderate attenuation constant, it could achieve the maximum penetration of the EM wave and the minimum reflection after  absorbing wave. As a result, the minimum reflection loss (RLmin) was as low as −40.7 dB, and the effective absorption band covered the entire low-frequency range from 2 to 8 GHz. Its excellent absorption performance was mainly due to the synergistic effect of various dielectric attenuation mechanisms, including defect polarization, dipole polarization, and conduction loss. Furthermore, thermogravimetric (TG) analysis showed that the sample exhibited excellent thermal stability and could withstand temperatures up to 550 °C in air and 1000 °C in an argon gas environment. The relevant work could provide meaningful references for the design of new high-performance ceramic wave-absorbing materials.}

abstract = {SiC ceramics are attractive electromagnetic (EM) absorption materials for the application in harsh environment because of their low density, good dielectric tunable performance, and chemical stability. However, the performance of current SiC-based materials to absorb EM wave is generally unsatisfactory due to poor impedance matching. Herein, we report ultralight SiC/Si3N4 composite aerogels (~15 mg·cm−3) consisting of numerous interweaving SiC nanowires and Si3N4 nanoribbons. Aerogels were prepared via siloxane pyrolysis and chemical vapor reaction through the template method. The optimal aerogel exhibits excellent EM wave absorption properties with a strong reflection loss (RL, −48.6 dB) and a wide effective absorption band (EAB, 7.4 GHz) at a thickness of 2 mm, attributed to good impedance matching and multi attenuation mechanisms of waves within the unique network structure. In addition, the aerogel exhibits high thermal stability in air until 1000 ℃ and excellent thermal insulation performance (0.030 W·m−1·K−1). These superior performances make the SiC/Si3N4 composite aerogel promising to become a new generation of absorption material served under extreme conditions.}

abstract = {Abstract Recently, the design and development of efficient microwave absorbents by facile engineering approaches have attracted much attention. Particularly, some unique structures caused by cross-scale design are promising in enhancing the absorbing capability toward microwave irradiation. Herein, the cross-scale design strategy is implemented to enhance the electromagnetic wave absorption performance of polymetallic sulfides (PMS). In PMS, the dipole polarization unit is optimized, and the distribution of electronic states is improved by doping Ti atoms; Meanwhile, the MS/M3S4 homogeneous hetero-phases interfaces is constructed in PMS using a phase separation strategy; and the conductivity of PMS is modulated by the addition of acetylene black (ACET). The cross-scale synergy of microwave absorption leads to a significant enhancement of the microwave absorption (MA) performance of PMS/ACET composites. The optimal reflection loss value of Ti-LES with 10\% ACET addition reaches −55.49 dB and the effective absorption bandwidth reaches 6.73 GHz. The 17.5\% ACET-conditioned Ti-HES achieves a reflection loss of −37.2 dB at a low frequency of 4.8 GHz. This study not only provides a novel strategy for the development of new broadband MA materials but also validates a new idea for the multi-scale synergistic optimization of MA materials.},

abstract = {The development of advanced and efficient microwave-absorbing materials through the precise regulation of dielectric loss and impedance matching remains a significant challenge. In this study, (Hf0.25Zr0.25Ta0.25Nb0.25)C–SiC (HEC–SiC) biphasic ceramic powders were synthesized via a single-source-precursor route. The SiC content was systematically controlled by adjusting the amount of methyltrimethoxysilane. The resulting polymer-derived HEC–SiC composite exhibited a unique microstructure, with nanosized SiC particles uniformly distributed throughout the HEC matrix. As a result, the HEC–SiC-2 composite, containing approximately 21.21 wt% SiC, achieved a minimum reflection loss value (RLmin) of −54.28 dB at 12.39 GHz with a thickness of 3.14 mm. The superior microwave attenuation capability is attributed to optimized impedance matching, enhanced interfacial polarization between the HEC matrix and nanosized SiC, and dipole polarization induced by defects within HEC. This study offers a novel strategy for the fabrication of high-entropy ceramic–SiC biphasic composites with excellent microwave absorbing properties, paving the way for their application in electromagnetic interference shielding and stealth technologies.}

   abstract = {As a lot of electromagnetic pollution and interference issues have emerged, to overcome electromagnetic interference, prevent electromagnetic hazards, and develop new high-performance electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers have become a significant task in the field of materials science. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanofibers network with core–shell structure, embedded with varied molar ratios of iron and cobalt (4:0, 3:1, 2:2, 1:3, 0:4), was effectively synthesized (Fe/Co@C-CNFs) via electrospinning. The phase, microstructure, magnetic and EMW absorption properties were studied. It is discovered that Fe/Co@C-CNFs doped with iron: cobalt = 1:1 have excellent EMW absorption capacity. When the matching thickness is 1.08 mm, the minimum reflection loss (RL) value is − 18.66 dB, while the maximum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaches 4.2 GHz (13.9–18 GHz) at a thickness of 1.22 mm. This is owing to the absorbers' superior impedance matching and multiple reflections as well as the conductivity, dielectric, and magnetic losses of carbon nanofibers embedded with Fe–Co alloy particles. In addition, the radar cross section (RCS) of the absorbers has been calculated by CST Studio Suite, showing that the absorbing coating can effectively reduce the RCS at various angles, especially for Fe/Co@C-CNFs doped with iron:cobalt = 1:1. These findings not only provide new insights for the preparation of lightweight and high-performance electromagnetic wave absorbers, but also contribute to energy storage and conversion.},

abstract = {Abstract Electrospun polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon composite fibers embedded with magnetic nanoparticles have been developed as materials for electromagnetic wave absorption. The nanocomposite fibers were prepared by electrospinning from a dispersion of magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles stabilized by L-glutamic acid in a solution of PAN and N, N-dimethyl formamide. The Fe3O4-embedded PAN nanofibers were stabilized at 270°C in air and carbonized at 800°C in nitrogen. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles were crystalline with a particle size of about 7 nm, most of which was reduced to Fe3C with agglomerates of up to 50 nm diameter in the carbon fibers. The carbon morphology was mostly disordered, but exhibited a layered graphitic structure in the vicinity of the nanoparticles. The carbon composite fiber exhibited ferromagnetic behavior, and the induced magnetic saturation per unit mass of fibers increased with increasing Fe3O4 content in the precursor. The complex relative dielectric permittivity was tuned by adjusting the amount of Fe3O4 in the carbon fiber precursor. With increasing Fe3O4 content, good electromagnetic wave absorption characteristics were observed below 6 GHz, even for samples with fiber loadings as low as 5 wt \%. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

With the introduction of porous nanostructure, the permittivity of carbon nanofibers was decreased at low frequency and the impedance matching of permittivity and permeability was realized. The electromagnetic absorbing properties were investigated in detail.

We have successfully synthesized ZrCw using a carbothermal reduction technique without the introduction of metal catalytic in this paper. ZrCw shows a typically prismatic structure with the diameter of 1–2 μm and the aspect ratio of up to 250. The growth of ZrCw is controlled by a solid-liquid-solid (SLS) and vapor-solid (VS) compound mechanism in conjunction with the auxiliary action of mesophase Na3ZrF7. The ZrCw/paraffin hybrids achieve the minimum reflection loss (RL(min)) of −25.77 dB at 13.28 GHz under the thickness of 1.25 mm, and reach an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 3.04 GHz (14.96–18.00 GHz) with a thickness of only 1.0 mm.

In this study, we prepared flexible nanofiber mats containing ZrO2, ZrC, and ZrB2 phases as EM absorbers by one-step electrospinning and high-temperature pyrolysis. The ceramic nanofiber mats, pyrolyzed at 1300 ℃ and mixed with paraffin, exhibit a broadband effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 8.64 GHz at a thickness of 2.4 mm. Additionally, the mats demonstrate exceptional oxidation resistance up to 1400 ℃. Nanoscale conductive networks with multiple ceramic absorbers are promising candidates for EM absorption applications in high-temperature EM stealth of complex structural components and high-temperature oxidation protection.}

abstract = {Carbon-based materials, renowned for their low density, adjustable electrical conductivity, superior corrosion resistance and mechanical properties, and have found extensive applications in the field of electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA). Despite their merits, the current EMWA and thermal insulation capabilities are not fully optimized, thereby restricting their applications in the aerospace sector. Herein, we introduce a combinatory methodology employing electrospinning followed by pyrolysis to in-situ integrate ZrO2 and ZrB2 nanoparticles onto the surface of carbon nanofibers, culminating in a flexible ZrO2/ZrB2/C nanofiber felt. The integration of ZrO2 and ZrB2 nanoparticles significantly augments impedance matching and promotes multifaceted scattering and interfacial polarization. Consequently, the ZrO2/ZrB2/C nanofiber felt demonstrates a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −54 dB and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, RL ≤ −10 dB) is 3.1 GHz. Moreover, the three-dimensional porous architecture and the presence of multiple heterogeneous interfaces endow the ZrO2/ZrB2/C nanofiber felt with an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.016 W⸱m−1⸱K−1 at 1100 °C, underscoring its exceptional potential for infrared stealth. This work shows considerable guiding significance for the design of bi-functional EMWA materials with ultralow thermal conductivity in aerospace field.}

abstract = {The multifunctionality of electromagnetic wave absorption (EMW) materials plays a crucial role in addressing the challenges posed by complex electromagnetic environments. Herein, a multifunctional ZrO2 interface engineering-modified SiC nanofiber aerogel (ZS-HNFA-x) that integrates elasticity, thermal insulation, and hydrophobicity has been successfully developed through an electrospinning-combined freeze-drying process. The aerogel is interconnected by an Si-O-Si network, forming a porous structure with complex interfaces, which not only promotes the formation of hydrophobic structures but also suppresses heat conduction while enhancing compressive strength. Specifically, the ZS-HNFA-1 possesses ultra-low density (6.6 mg•cm−3), outstanding hydrophobic properties in various humid environments (hot/cold water, acidic, and alkaline corrosive liquids), excellent elasticity (with complete recovery from 60% repeated strain), and remarkable thermal stability (∼1200℃) and insulation (24.07 W·m−1·K−1). Moreover, the ZrO2 interface-engineering strategy not only introduce abundant heterointerfaces but also significantly improve impedance matching characteristics, which consequently enhances the EMW absorption performance. Notably, the optimal ZS-HNFA-x possesses superior EMW absorption performance (the minimum reflection loss of −53.2 dB and effective absorption bandwidth of 6.4 GHz at 2.4 mm thickness). This research offers valuable insights into the design of multifunctional ceramics with superior electromagnetic wave absorption properties for applications in harsh environments.}

abstract = {Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) aerogels have attracted extensive attention due to their unique physical properties, but their poor mechanical properties and insufficient functionality hinder their further application. In this study, we propose a strategy for fiber-reinforced rGO aerogels for mechanical enhancement and multifunctional applications. We fabricated carbon fibers (CFs) modified with zirconia (ZrO2) particles to enhance rGO aerogels. The resulting aerogels exhibit exceptional lightweight characteristics (8.62 mg cm−3) and high compressive deformation up to 90 % (320 kPa), and a low thermal conductivity of 25.3 mW m−1 K−1. Simultaneously, the aerogel demonstrates excellent electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption performance, with a minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −62.99 dB at 3.4 mm and an effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 8.19 GHz. The introduction of ZrO2 achieves three ends with a single effort: it enhances mechanical performance, disrupts thermal conduction pathways within the aerogel framework while simultaneously optimizing impedance matching. This synergistic effect enables dual-band compatibility for radar-infrared stealth applications, demonstrating significant potential for aerospace applications.}

In this work, we introduce a facile carbon thermal shock method to prepare ZrO2/C composites using UIO 66 (Zr) as the precursor. The instant heating and cooling process ensures the uniform deposition of nano-sized ZrO2 (ca. 5–15 nm) on graphene, exhibiting an ultrahigh interfacial number density of ca. 1015 m−2 that favors polarization loss. Due to the synergetic effect of dielectric loss and impedance matching, the prepared ZrO2/graphene composites show tunable wide-microwave absorption performance by adjusting the heat temperature, and possess a wide absorption band covering the entire X and Ku band. Notably, the ZrO2/graphene composites show high thermal stability up to 1000 °C, which presents great potential for microwave absorption applications.}
